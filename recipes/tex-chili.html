                <li>Dried Chiles</li>
                <li>Chuck Roast</li>
                <li>Onion</li>
                <li>Masa Harina</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>

                <li>Bay Leaves</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place peppers in a large skillet and heat over medium-low heat; cook, turning once, until lightly toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chiles to a bowl and cover with hot water; let stand for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Drain chiles, reserving about 1/2 cup of the soaking water. Use a paring knife to slice open each pepper, and remove and discard stems and seeds by running under a gentle stream of tap water.</li>
                <li>Combine chiles, chipotle pepper, and reserved 1/2 cup water in a blender; blend until a smooth paste forms, 15 to 30 seconds. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Toss beef cubes in a large bowl with salt and pepper until evenly coated. Add half of the beef to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring occasionally to brown most sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining beef.</li>
                <li>Add onions and garlic to drippings in Dutch oven and cook, stirring constantly, until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cumin and cinnamon, and cook, stirring constantly, until darkened and fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            </ol>
